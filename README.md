# Horiseon Code Refactor

The code in this repository has been refactored and reorganized for the clients needs.

### Changes

The changes that were made to this site come as followed:

- Cleaned up the code, multiple semantic errors in the HTML and CSS sheets were changed, such as header, aside, nav, and footer.
- Both sheets have been reorganized to fit the sites layout, and done with the thought of customization in the future.
- Many CSS values have been grouped to create a more open looking stylesheet.
